    "Part 2: Data We Need\n",
    "1- We will need geo-locational information about that specific borough and the neighborhoods in that borough. We specifically and technically mean the latitude and longitude numbers of that borough. We assume that it is \"Scarborough\" in Toronto. This is easily provided for us by the contractor, because the contractor has already made up his mind about the borough. The Postal Codes that fall into that borough (Scarborough) would also be sufficient fo us. I fact we will first find neighborhoods inside Scarborough by their corresponding Postal Codes.\n",
    "2- We will need data about different venues in different neighborhoods of that specific borough. In order to gain that information we will use \"Foursquare\" locational information. By locational information for each venue we mean basic and advanced information about that venue. For example there is a venue in one of the neighborhoods. As basic information, we can obtain its precise latitude and longitude and also its distance from the center of the neighborhood. But we are looking for advanced information such as the category of that venue and whether this venue is a popular one in its category or maybe the average price of the services of this venue. A typical request from Foursquare will provide us with the following information:\n",
    "[Postal Code] [Neighborhood(s)] [Neighborhood Latitude] [Neighborhood Longitude] [Venue] [Venue Summary] [Venue Category] [Distance (meter)]\n",
    "[M1L] [Clairlea, Golden Mile, Oakridge] [43.711112] [-79.284577] [Tim Hortons] [This spot is popular] [Coffee Shop] [592]\n",
